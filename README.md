# 📊 Placement Data Analysis

This repository contains a dataset titled `placement.csv`, which includes information about student placements. The aim of this project is to analyze trends in placements, explore key influencing factors, and generate insights using Python and data science tools.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset `placement.csv` includes the following features (columns):

- `sl_no`: Serial number of the record
- `gender`: Gender of the student (`M` / `F`)
- `ssc_p`: Secondary Education percentage (10th Grade)
- `ssc_b`: Board of Secondary Education (`Central` / `Others`)
- `hsc_p`: Higher Secondary Education percentage (12th Grade)
- `hsc_b`: Board of Higher Secondary Education
- `hsc_s`: Specialization in Higher Secondary (`Commerce`, `Science`, `Arts`)
- `degree_p`: Degree Percentage
- `degree_t`: Undergrad Degree Type (`Sci&Tech`, `Comm&Mgmt`, `Others`)
